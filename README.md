# CitiBike_03.24.Analysis
This assignment was completed with the support of my peers. 
Note: Many of the files affiliated with this project were too large to upload into Github. Still working on what files are relevant for upload. The jupyter source file used to clean the data for visualization is included, and the data from Citibike utilized are the 3-part csv series from March 2024.

## Background
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage. https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so this assignment builds a set of data reports to provide answers.
